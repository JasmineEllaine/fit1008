Write a page of text, using what you know of theory to analyse
how the performance of your text editor would change when
switching implementations.

The complexity will change for certain functions.

Insertion and deletion will be faster and more efficient with 
    linked lists as shifting indices is not required like in
    an array. 

Accessing an item more direct with an array, as opposed to a
    linked list where you must first traverse through the items
    until the one needed is found.

Searching can be either binary or linear with an array based list,
    while it is only linear through a linked list.

There is less memory required for an array based list, however a
    linked list is more efficient at utilising memory.
